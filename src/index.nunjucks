<h3>Sources of funding:</h3>
<p>Candidates raise money from a variety of different sources. Large
contributions are classified as donations coming from individuals who have
given at least $200 to the candidate during the election cycle. Small
contributions are from individuals who gave less. Political action committees
are allowed to give up to $5,000 directly to each candidate in a given election cycle.
Percentages might not add to 100 percent because of loans, candidate
self-funding and transfers from other committees.

<h3>There are different kinds of PACs.</h3>
<p>Not all PACs are the same -- they represent a variety of different interests
and groups. Broadly, PACs can be classified into four main categories. Ideological
PACs work to advance a particular issue or set of issues. PACs in this category
include EMILYâ€™s List, which works to elect female Democratic candidates, and
No Labels, which aims to reduce partisanship. Leadership PACs are associated with
a particular politician. Many members of Congress have these PACs, which they use
to support other candidates. Labor PACs advance the interests of labor unions, and
are often funded by union members. Business PACs, sometimes referred to as corporate
PACs, generally work to advance the interests of the businesses or corporate groups
that they represent.
